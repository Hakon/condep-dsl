condep-dsl
==========
This is the core DSL in ConDep and probably not what you're looking for :-) Unless you allready know ConDep really well and are looking for information of how to extend it with your own operations or in other ways use the internals of ConDep. 

For general information about ConDep and how to use it do enable Continuous Deployment/Delivery, check out www.con-dep.net.

ConDep.Dsl is the internal domain specific language (DSL) that simplifies the hard stuff about continuous deployment on the Windows plattform. Things like remote deployment, remote execution and remote installation. [condep-dsl-operations](https://github.com/condep/condep-dsl-operations) (another component of ConDep) uses this DSL to expose a set of commonly used operations for executing remote (or local) tasks, and effecivly extend the DSL to make it really easy to use.
