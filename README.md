condep-dsl
==========
This is the core DSL in ConDep. For information about what ConDep is, check out www.con-dep.net.

ConDep.Dsl is the internal domain specific language (DSL) that simplifies the hard stuff about continuous deployment on the Windows plattform. Things like remote deployment, remote execution and remote installation. [condep-dsl-operations](https://github.com/condep/condep-dsl-operations) (another component of ConDep) uses this DSL to expose a set of commonly used operations for executing remote (or local) tasks, and effecivly extend the DSL to make it really easy to use.
